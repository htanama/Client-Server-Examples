This is an examples code for socket programming

These are just basic sending and receiving message from client to server and back to client to echo a simple message. 

socket does not use secured layer

There are 3 examples:
echo_client connect with echo_server

echo_client2 connect with echo_server2

echo_client_hello connect with echo_server_hello

The binary application is located on the build folder and the source code located on the src folder

The Makefile is just an example build script that can be use to compile the source code. 

The source code will compile using GNU GCC or clang.
